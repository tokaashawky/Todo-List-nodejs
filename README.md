# üìù Todo List Node.js Application ‚Äì DevOps Implementation

## üìå Task Overview (Part 1)

This project is a fork of the original [Todo-List-nodejs](https://github.com/Ankit6098/Todo-List-nodejs) repository. It has been extended to include:

- MongoDB database configuration
- Docker containerization
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- Image push to a **private Docker registry**

## üöÄ Steps to Reproduce

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankit6098/Todo-List-nodejs.git
cd Todo-List-nodejs
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your MongoDB
Update the .env file to use your own MongoDB instance:
```bash
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dockerize the Application
A **Dockerfile** has been added to containerize the Node.js app.
Build and Run the Docker Image:
```bash  
  docker build -t tokashawky/todo-list-nodejs:latest -f Docker/Dockerfile .
  # docker run --env-file .env -p 4000:4000 tokashawky/todo-list-nodejs:latest
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions workflow is configured to:
- Build the Docker image
- Authenticate to Docker Hub
- Push the image to a private Docker registry

#### üîê Secrets Required
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
```bash  
  DOCKER_USERNAME ‚Äì Your Docker Hub username
  DOCKER_PASSWORD ‚Äì Your Docker Hub access token or password
```
Once pushed to main, GitHub Actions will:
- Build the image
- Push it to docker.io/<your-username>/todo-list-nodejs:latest (private)

## üìå Ansible Setup on remote Ubuntu EC2 (Part 2)

### 1- Download the SSH Private Key
Create Ec2 and download its SSH Private Key.

### 2- Set Secure Permissions
```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/ToDo_KeyPair.pem
# AWS requires 400 permissions for the key to be used with SSH.
```

### 3- Configure SSH Shortcut from your local machine
```bash 
# Edit your SSH config:
vim ~/.ssh/config
```
Add:
```bash 
host TODO
    hostname Ec2_public_IP
    IdentityFile ToDo_KeyPair.pem
    User ubuntu
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

### 4- Test the Connection
```bash
  ssh TODO
```
If it logs in to the EC2 instance, you're ready to use Ansible from your machine:
Make sure **ToDo_KeyPair.pem** inside **Ansible** directory
```bash
cd Ansible
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
```

### 5- Verify Docker on EC2
```bash
ssh TODO
docker --version
```

## üìå On the VM, use docker compose to run the application (Part 3)

### 1- Prerequisites on the EC2
Make sure your Ansible playbook (from Part 2) has already done the following:
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- ubuntu user added to the docker R
- Your app image pushed to Docker Hub (private or public)
- .env file placed at /home/ubuntu/.env

### 2- Upload Compose + .env File
From local:
```bash
scp -i ToDo_KeyPair.pem ../Docker/docker-compose.yaml ubuntu@ec2_public_IP:~
scp -i ToDo_KeyPair.pem ../.env ubuntu@ec2_public_IP:~
```

### 3- Run the Application On the EC2
On EC2: 
```bash 
  # on ubuntu home
  docker login -u tokashawky 
  docker-compose up 
  # Check container status
  docker ps
```
Note: Don't forget
- Whitelist your EC2 public IP in MongoDB Atlas
  Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard: Navigate to Network Access, Click ‚ÄúAdd IP Address‚Äù 
- You need to allow port 4000 in the security group attached to your EC2

### 3- Test auto Update Justification (Watchtower)
To continuously check for changes in the Docker image and pull updates, use Watchtower, a tool that monitors Docker images and automatically updates running containers. Watchtower is chosen for its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ability to handle private registries securely.

1- Add Watchtower to docker-compose.yml
2- Update and Restart Docker Compose:
  - Copy the updated docker-compose.yml to the VM
  - On the VM, restart Docker Compose:
```bash
    docker compose down
    docker compose up -d
```
3- Make a change in your app repo.
4- Rebuild and push the Docker image:
```bash 
  docker build -t tokashawky/todo-list-nodejs:latest .
  docker push tokashawky/todo-list-nodejs:latest
```
Wait 30‚Äì60 seconds and on the VM, run:
```bash 
docker ps
```
‚Üí You should see that todo-app was restarted with the new image (check home page).

NOTE:
To have **Secure Approach for Watchtower Credentials**
```bash 
docker login -u tokashawky
cat ~/.docker/config.json
```
Verify the login:You should see an auths section with a base64-encoded token

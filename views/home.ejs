            <span class="para-first-word">To-do lists</span> are a list of tasks that an individual needs to complete or accomplish.
            Tasks are typically put in order by priority or importance. A to-do list can be written
            on a piece of paper or by utilizing task management software. Items on the list can
            pertain to one's personal or professional life.

            Benefits of to-do lists
        </p>
        <p class="para2">
            When done correctly, there are many benefits one may experience when creating a to-do list. Some of these
            benefits are:

            Sharpen memory: A to-do list can act as an external memory aid since it’s only possible to hold a few pieces
            of information at once. Keeping a to-do list up-to-date makes it easy to keep track of every task. This list
            also can reinforce the information in case something is forgotten.
            Increase productivity: Making a to-do list can prioritize the most important tasks and need to be completed
            first. This prevents wasting time on tasks that don’t require immediate attention.
            Boost motivation: A to-do list can be used as a motivational tool because it helps to clarify and break down
            long-term goals into smaller, more achievable short-term goals. Additionally, as someone crosses items off a
            to-do list, they’re likely to experience a boost in confidence, too.
            Improve time management: Since tasks on a to-do list should be organized by importance, understanding which
            projects or items need to be worked on first can improve time management.
